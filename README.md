# FFRK-Mastery-Scraper
Script for scraping the mastery survey threads on /r/FFRecordKeeper

To run this yourself, you'll need Python 3 plus a few dependencies, all of which you can get with "pip install blah":

PRAW - the Python Reddit API

strsimpy - string similarity library for catching typos/abbreviations

numpy - for doing the stats for string similarity metrics


You'll also need to add your own client ID and secret inside the script to use the Reddit API. Visual directions are here - it only takes like two minutes if you already have a Reddit account:

Ctrl+F for "client_secret" to find where to put your ID and secret
